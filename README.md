daily-xml-plugin
================

This is a plugin we (mostly Andrew, with contributions from Nitesh) created to export WordPress articles to XML in a format that imports into InDesign with all the correct Tufts Daily styles.

Here's how to push to the server.

git remote add web ssh://tuftsdaily.com/the-plugin-directory

git push web 

Be sure to be up to date with github first!
